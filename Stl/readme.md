<h1>STL IN C++</h1>
<h3>The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.
It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.</h3>
